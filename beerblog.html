	<p>Zatte was the first beer to be produced by the brewery way back in 1985 and is a tripel, the category reserved for the stronger, blonde beers in Belgian tradition. This beer more than lives up to its reputation and is an excellent example of what an exciting tripel should be like.The appearance of this beer is a  mystically murky amber colour, full of bubbles with great head retention. The enticing appearance of this beer is matched by its fruity aroma. The aroma has a malty sweetness that is mixed together with hints of citrus with a delicate yeast finish.</p> The flavour backs up the intriguing appearance and exciting aroma. There is an extremely malty flavour, which is complimented by a subtle bitter notes that retains in your mouth throughout, complimenting one another. These basic flavours are mixed together with hints of nuttiness and spices. This is a good beer that deserves to be drunk in places other than its unique brewery. </p><br>

	<p>I tucked into this little bad boy while tuning into England vs Moldova; the beer was in fact much more exciting than watching England thrash one of the worst teams in the world (no offence !!!!).<p>So to the beer. I am going start this review by commenting on the packaging. I think the turquoise label is not only warm and inviting but also gives the beer a very unique image, which compliments the flavours inside. The appearance of this beer is a light amber colour, which has a clear carbonated body full of freshness and vibrancy.<p>Before jumping in and drinking this beer one must smell it and as with any good beer this is where the magic happens. Dead Pony has a great aroma that jumps out at you; it is fresh with a summer sweetness, dominated by an apricot aroma that entices you to get drinking.<p>After smelling this summer party in a bottle I was excited to try the beer. Surprisingly however I anticipated that there would be a depth of sweetness; this was however not met and was instead overpowered by an explosion of subtle hoppy bitter flavours. These hoppy flavours left a pleasant subtle sweet citrus lingering in my mouth. This was surprising, as with such a strong sweet aroma I would have expected overpowering sweet flavours. The lack of sweetness was however greeted positively as I believe that too sweet a beer can be sickly.</p>Overall Dead Pony is a beautifully aromatic beer, full of hoppy complex flavour, packed into a light beer with a refreshingly crisp finish.</p>
